# Product list with cart

challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the products in a local data.json file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

Add items to the cart and remove them
Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
Navigate the whole project and perform all actions using only their keyboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page



This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production
